This website is purely a fun project and does not have any real purpose.

It is meant to be a visualisation of a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)">Munchkin</a>.

## ToDo

- [ ] Seperate logic from surface, we need a player bubble class or something like that, that handles all data for a player.
- [ ] Add total player level to player bubble.
- [ ] Add Combat dialog, when a player battles a monster
